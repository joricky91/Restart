# Restart

This is the second app created as a part of SwiftUI + SwiftData Masterclass - iOS App Development Swift course projects. New things that I learned in this second project:
- Animation: I'm not that familiar with animations in iOS Development, and this project really taught me so much about animation! It includes using the withAnimation, animation types such as easeIn and easeOut, how to trigger animation, and create complex animations.
- Sound: I also learn how to play a sound file in the app using AVFoundation framework.

Thank you so much for Robert Petras for this project and teachings!
